mr and mrs dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much they were the last people youd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just didnt hold with such nonsense mr dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache mrs dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere the dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it they didnt think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters mrs potter was mrs dursleys sister but they hadnt met for several years in fact mrs dursley pretended she didnt have a sister because her sister and her good for nothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they didnt want dudley mixing with a child like that when mr and mrs dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country mr dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window at half past eight mr dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley good bye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls little tyke chortled mr dursley as he left the house he got into his car and backed out of number fours drive it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map for a second mr dursley didnt realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there wasnt a map in sight what could he have been thinking of it must have been a trick of the light mr dursley blinked and stared at the cat it stared back as mr dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror it was now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cats couldnt read maps or signs mr dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he couldnt help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about people in cloaks mr dursley couldnt bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people he supposed this was some stupid new fashion he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by they were whispering excitedly together mr dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them werent young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emerald green cloak the nerve of him but then it struck mr dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something  yes that would be it the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills mr dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor if he hadnt he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning he didnt see the owls swooping past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime mr dursley however had a perfectly normal owl free morning he yelled at five different people he made several important telephone
